+ StyLess: Boosting the Transferability of Adversarial Examples  
Kaisheng Liang, Bin Xiao   
[[paper](https://web.comp.polyu.edu.hk/csbxiao/paper/2023/11004_styless_boosting_the_transfera-Camera-ready%20PDF.pdf)] [[code](https://github.com/uhiu/StyLess)]  
  <details>
    <summary>Notes</summary>
    CNN-based: We find that existing transferable attacks do not distinguish between style and content features during optimization, limiting their attack transferability. To improve attack transferability, we propose a novel attack method called style-less perturbation (StyLess). Specifically, instead of using a vanilla network as the surrogate model, we advocate using stylized networks, which encode different style features by perturbing an adaptive instance normalization. Our method can prevent adversarial examples from using non-robust style features and help generate transferable perturbations.

  <details>
    <summary>Notes</summary>
    CNN-based: we propose the Path-Augmented Method (PAM). Specifically, PAM first constructs a candidate augmentation path pool. It then settles the employed augmentation paths during adversarial sample generation with greedy search. Furthermore, to avoid augmenting semantics-inconsistent images, we train a Semantics Predictor (SP) to constrain the length of the augmentation path.

    This paper proposes a novel plug-in framework called Sensitive RegionAware Attack (SRA) to generate soft-label black-box adversarial examples using the sensitivity map and evolution strategies. First, a transferable blackbox sensitivity map generation approach is proposed for identifying the sensitive regions of input images. To perform SRA with a limited amount of perturbed pixels, a dynamic l0 and lâˆž adjustment strategy is introduced. Furthermore, an adaptive evolution strategy is employed to optimize the selection of generated sensitive regions, allowing for the execution of effective and imperceptible attacks.

  <details>
    <summary>Notes</summary>
    In this paper, we rethink adversarial transferability from a data distribution perspective and further enhance transferability by score matching based optimization. We identify that some samples with injecting small Gaussian noise can fool different target models, and their adversarial examples under different source models have much stronger transferability. We hypothesize that these samples are in the low-density region of the ground truth distribution where models are not well trained. To improve the attack success rate of adversarial examples, we match the adversarial attacks with the directions which effectively decrease the ground truth density. We propose Intrinsic Adversarial Attack (IAA), which smooths the activation function and decreases the impact of the later layers of a given normal model, to increase the alignment of adversarial attack and the gradient of joint data distribution.

    <summary>Notes</summary>
    In this work, we present NEO, a model agnostic framework to detect and mitigate such backdoor attacks in image classification ML models. For a given image classification model, our approach analyses the inputs it receives and determines if the model is backdoored. In addition to this feature, we also mitigate these attacks by determining the correct predictions of the poisoned images.
